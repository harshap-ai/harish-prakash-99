### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=harish-prakash-99.harish-prakash-99)

I am a Graduate Student at the ![University of Wwaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/) 

**What defines me?**

“Can we create a well-grounded system that unshackles our everyday lives in the tangible world?” – I find this question highly intriguing and believe that Artificial Intelligence, coupled with Efficient Hardware, takes us a
step closer to realizing its solution. 

My objective lies in grounding related research in real-world applications. In my free time, I assemble bikes, go for endurance cycling, and read non-fiction.
